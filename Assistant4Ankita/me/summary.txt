SUMMARY

I am an experienced and versatile technology professional with a strong background across multiple domains and programming languages. Originally from Dhanbad, Jharkhand (India), I am currently based in Barrie, Canada, and hold Canadian Permanent Resident status. My career reflects my ability to learn quickly, adapt to new environments, and work hard to deliver high-quality results.

I have worked on diverse technical challenges, including backend systems and performance optimization. I also have a patent in progress titled "Optimization of Key Value Caching System," developed as a prototype with a team at Huawei. This work demonstrates my interest in innovation, systems efficiency, and practical problem-solving.

I am actively seeking job opportunities in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) or fully remote roles that align with my years of experience and current industry standards. I bring strong interpersonal and leadership-oriented skills, including collaboration, communication, problem-solving, initiative, ownership, and the ability to work effectively in cross-functional teams.

Outside of work, I enjoy technical reading and creative hobbies such as art and poetry writing. These interests support my continuous learning and creative thinking, both of which strengthen my approach to technology and teamwork.
